Create a calculator in C using only VIM.
Program should be able to take in strings like "5*5" and return 25.


NEXT UP:
- Look in to string splitting?
- Some input validation like too many ints, etc.

- Need to validate input string to see they are valid ints and a valid char (+, -, /, *)
- Then, this string needs to be split into two ints and a char for the case: loop.
